# Data returns acceptance tests

The Data Returns service will be a new [digital service](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/digital-by-default) for submitting environmental monitoring data to the [Environment Agency](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/environment-agency).  It is being developed in a phased approach, and the first type of data you will be able to submit is the landfill emissions monitoring data that is required by many environmental permits.

The first Phase is designed to allow Permit Holders to upload a CSV file that they have created, following guidance we will provide on GOV.UK.  With a little set-up effort, automated monitoring systems can be programmed to export the data in the desired format. Once this has been set-up it will deliver time savings for Permit Holders for every future data submission. It also saves time for the Environment Agency in processing the data.

The service will provide a format checker and helpful messages to help users ensure the data is in the correct format.

Later releases of the service will be designed for submission of data by individuals filling in the information on-line. This will be more suitable for users who do not have automated monitoring systems, and those who submit relatively small amounts of data.

## About this project

This project contains the acceptance tests for the Data Returns service. We use [Cucumber](https://cucumber.io/) as the means to both document and test the service, and this project contains the current features, step definitions and example CSV files.

It assumes use of [Chimp](https://github.com/xolvio/chimp) in order to run the tests.

## Pre-requisites
This project uses **Chimp** to run acceptance tests using cucumber-js and jasmine.  

* [Oracle JDK v1.8+](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)
* [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/)

## Installation


First clone the project from GitHub

```bash
git clone https://github.com/EnvironmentAgency/data-returns-acceptance-tests.git
```

To install project dependencies, open a console inside the root folder of git repository and run:

```bash
npm install

```

Next you'll need to create a `chimp.js` file in the root of the project folder. Use [example.chimp.js](example.chimp.js) for reference.

## Execution

###Standalone
Open a terminal and ensure you are at the root of the project. Then simply run

```bash
chimp
```

#### Browserstack
To run on browserstack additional configuration files are required:

**/browserstacklocal.json**

Configuration settings for the BrowserStackLocal binary.  This agent allows browserstack.com to route traffic via the local machine and 
requires settings as per the example below. "key" is the only required argument but "forcelocal" is likely always needed to allow traffic to 
route via the local host.  For a full guide to the different options see  the [BrowserStackLocal Modifiers Guide](https://www.browserstack.com/local-testing#modifiers) 
and the [browserstack-local NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/browserstack-local) 

```json
{
  "key": "BROWSERSTACK_ACCESS_KEY",
  "force": "true",
  "forcelocal": "true",
  "only": "nonsslserver.domain,80,0,sslserver.domain:443,1",
  "onlyAutomate": true,
  "forceproxy": "true",
  "proxyHost": "proxyserver.domain",
  "proxyPort": "3128",
  "proxyUser": "username",
  "proxyPass": "password"
}
```

### Run a specific feature

If you want to run a single feature use

```bash
chimp features/error_messages_DR_reference.feature
```

If its just a single scenario you want to see then use

```bash
chimp features/error_messages_DR_reference.feature:14
```

The `:14` relates to the line number that the **scenario** starts from in the `.feature` file.
